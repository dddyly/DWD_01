" This essay is an effort to build an ironic political myth faithful to feminism, socialism, and materialism. ",

" Perhaps more faithful as blasphemy is faithful, than as reverent worship and identification. ",

" Blasphemy has always seemed to require taking things very seriously. ",

" I know no better stance to adopt from within the secular-religious, evangelical traditions of United States politics, including the politics of socialist feminism. ",

" Blasphemy protects one from the moral majority within, while still insisting on the need for community. ",

" Blasphemy is not apostasy. ",

" Irony is about contradictions that do not resolve into larger wholes, even dialectically, about the tension of holding incompatible things together because both or all are necessary and true. ",

" Irony is about humour and serious play. ",

" It is also a rhetorical strategy and a political method, one I would like to see more honoured within socialist-feminism. ",

" At the centre of my ironic faith, my blasphemy, is the image of the cyborg. ",

" A cyborg is a cybernetic organism, a hybrid of machine and organism, a creature of social reality as well as a creature of fiction. ",

" Social reality is lived social relations, our most important political construction, a world-changing fiction. ",

" The international women's movements have constructed 'women's experience', as well as uncovered or discovered this crucial collective object. ",

" This experience is a fiction and fact of the most crucial, political kind. ",

" Liberation rests on the construction of the consciousness, the imaginative apprehension, of oppression, and so of possibility. ",

" The cyborg is a matter of fiction and lived experience that changes what counts as women's experience in the late twentieth century. ",

" This is a struggle over life and death, but the boundary between science fiction and social reality is an optical illusion. ",

" Contemporary science fiction is full of cyborgs—creatures simultaneously animal and machine, who populate worlds ambiguously natural and crafted. ",

" Modern medicine is also full of cyborgs, of couplings between organism and machine, each conceived as coded devices, in an intimacy and with a power that was not generated in the history of sexuality. ",

" Cyborg 'sex' restores some of the lovely replicative baroque of ferns and invertebrates (such nice organic prophylactics against heterosexism). ",

" Cyborg replication is uncoupled from organic reproduction. ",

" Modern production seems like a dream of cyborg colonization work, a dream that makes the nightmare of Taylorism seem idyllic. ",

" And modern war is a cyborg orgy, coded by C3I, command-control-communication-intelligence, an $84 billion item in 1984's US defence budget. ",

" I am making an argument for the cyborg as a fiction mapping our social and bodily reality and as an imaginative resource suggesting some very fruitful couplings. ",

" Michel Foucault's biopolitics is a flaccid premonition of cyborg politics, a very open field. "
